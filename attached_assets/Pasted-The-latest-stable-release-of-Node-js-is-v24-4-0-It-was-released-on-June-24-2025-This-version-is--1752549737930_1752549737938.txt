The latest stable release of Node.js is v24.4.0. It was released on June 24, 2025.  This version is considered the "Current" release line. Node.js also has a Long-Term Support (LTS) version, which is currently v22.17.0. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Here's a breakdown: 

• Latest Current Release: Node.js v24.4.0. 
• Latest LTS Release: Node.js v22.17.0. 
• Release Date of v24.4.0: June 24, 2025. [2, 3, 4, 5]  

To find the latest version and update: 

1. Check your current version: Open your terminal or command prompt and type node -v. [6]  
2. Download the latest version: Go to the official Node.js website (or use a package manager like npm or yarn) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system. [7, 8, 9]  
3. Install the new version: Follow the instructions provided with the installer or package manager. [7, 10]  
4. Verify the update: Run node -v again to confirm that your system is running the latest version. [7, 10, 11]  

To determine which version is best for your use case, consider: 

• "Current" releases: Offer the newest features and updates but may not be as stable as LTS versions. [12]  
• LTS releases: Recommended for production environments as they are more stable and receive long-term support (including security updates). [13, 14]  
• Node.js 22 LTS: A good option for production due to its long-term support, which is active until April 2027. [13, 15]
