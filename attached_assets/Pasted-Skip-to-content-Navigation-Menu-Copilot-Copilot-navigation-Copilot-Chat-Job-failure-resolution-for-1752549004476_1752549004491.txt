Copilot said: The job failed during the "Validate generated
The job failed during the "Validate generated files" step because either language-configuration.json or the syntaxes directory does not exist after running the generation script. Both are required for the tests to pass, as validated by these shell commands:

bash
test -f language-configuration.json
test -d syntaxes
Both files could not be retrieved from the repo, confirming at least one is missing.

Solution:

Check the output and logic of scripts/generate-languages.ts. Make sure that:
It creates language-configuration.json at the repo root.
It creates a syntaxes directory (with content) at the expected location.
If the script only generates these files conditionally or puts them in the wrong path, update its output paths.
If the script does not generate these files at all, add code to do so.
Example code suggestion for scripts/generate-languages.ts:

ts
import { writeFileSync, mkdirSync, existsSync } from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

// Ensure syntaxes directory exists
const syntaxesDir = path.resolve(__dirname, '../syntaxes');
if (!existsSync(syntaxesDir)) {
  mkdirSync(syntaxesDir);
  // Optionally, generate language definition files inside syntaxesDir
}

// Generate language-configuration.json at repo root
const langConfigPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../language-configuration.json');
writeFileSync(langConfigPath, JSON.stringify({
  // ...your language configuration here
}, null, 2));
Summary:
Update scripts/generate-languages.ts to ensure both language-configuration.json and the syntaxes directory are created at the repo root. Commit and push these changes—this will resolve the failing validation step.

If you need help with the generation script code, please share its contents.
