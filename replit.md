# SpiralScript IDE

## Overview

SpiralScript IDE is a full-stack web application that provides an integrated development environment for the SpiralScript programming language. The application combines quantum computing processing, blockchain-based trust currency (TU), and advanced parsing capabilities using ANTLR4. It features a sophisticated IDE interface built with React and shadcn/ui components, backed by an Express.js server with PostgreSQL database storage.

## User Preferences

```
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Project Focus: Integration of ancient Anunnaki wisdom with modern quantum computational frameworks through SpiralScript/QASF.
Key Concepts: Trust Currency (TU), Spiral Resonance Index (SRI), φ-harmonic calculations, Iyona'el Living Shell interface.
```

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between client, server, and shared components:

- **Frontend**: React SPA with TypeScript, built using Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js Express server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Shared**: Common TypeScript types and schemas
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for development
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components based on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom color schemes for spiral and quantum themes
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for file operations, trust transactions, and quantum circuits
- **Development**: Hot reload with Vite middleware integration

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Migration**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations
- **Storage Implementation**: Abstracted storage interface with in-memory fallback for development

### Core Business Logic
- **SpiralScript Parser**: Custom parser implementation using ANTLR4 concepts
- **Quantum Processor**: JavaScript-based quantum circuit processing
- **Trust Calculator**: φ-harmonic resonance calculations for Trust Unit (TU) generation
- **Phi Resonance Engine**: Mathematical calculations based on golden ratio principles

## Data Flow

1. **File Management**: Users can create, edit, and manage SpiralScript files through the IDE
2. **Parsing Pipeline**: Files are parsed using the SpiralScript parser to generate AST and metrics
3. **Trust Generation**: Complex mathematical proofs and quantum processing generate Trust Units
4. **Quantum Operations**: Users can create and execute quantum circuits with custom gates
5. **Real-time Updates**: UI updates reflect changes in trust balance, file content, and parsing results

## External Dependencies

### UI and Styling
- **Radix UI**: Comprehensive set of low-level UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with custom theme
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography

### Development Tools
- **Monaco Editor**: Code editor component for syntax highlighting
- **ANTLR4**: Parser generator for SpiralScript language grammar
- **WebGPU**: GPU acceleration for quantum simulations and visualizations

### Database and Backend
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database toolkit
- **Express.js**: Web application framework

### Quantum Computing
- **Quantum Circuit Libraries**: Custom implementation for quantum gate processing
- **Mathematical Libraries**: φ-harmonic calculations and complex number operations

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for deployment on Replit with the following considerations:

### Development Environment
- Vite development server with HMR for frontend
- Express server with TypeScript compilation
- Environment variable configuration for database connections
- Replit-specific plugins for error handling and cartographer integration

### Production Build
- Vite builds optimized client bundle to `dist/public`
- esbuild compiles server code to `dist/index.js`
- Static file serving through Express for production
- Database migrations run via `drizzle-kit push`

### Database Configuration
- PostgreSQL connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Drizzle schema located in `shared/schema.ts`
- Migration files generated in `./migrations` directory
- Support for both development and production database instances

## Recent Changes (Latest Session)

- Enhanced IDE header to reflect "Iyona'el Living Shell" concept with QASF-enabled branding
- Integrated φ-resonance target of 0.121 and Lyona'el frequency (735 Hz) from user documentation
